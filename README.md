# Polaritrionics Labs Security Research Archive

Welcome to the official repository of security research whitepapers from **Polaritrionics Labs**, led by principal researcher **Michael Rapoport**.

> Our work focuses on the exploration of unconventional, "next-generation" threats that operate beyond the scope of traditional cybersecurity paradigms. We specialize in the analysis of infrastructure-less, parasitic, and ephemeral systems that leverage the public internet commons for command, control, and computation.

## Research Philosophy

The core principle behind our research is "Living off the Cloud"—the idea that sophisticated global-scale operations can be conducted with zero operator-owned infrastructure. By creatively repurposing legitimate, high-availability public protocols (MQTT, DHT, WebRTC, etc.), we can construct resilient, untraceable, and powerful distributed systems. This archive serves as a collection of our findings, intended for defensive security professionals, academics, and protocol architects.

## Published Whitepapers & Research

### 📄 **PL-2026-X9: Chimeric Networks**

*   **Abstract:** *This research characterizes a novel class of "Infrastructure-less" distributed systems termed Chimeric Networks. By weaponizing the functional overlap between unauthenticated IoT signaling (MQTT), peer-to-peer discovery (MLDHT), and browser-native transport (WebRTC), we demonstrate a methodology for parasitic computation and residential proxying that resides entirely within legitimate public protocol traffic.*

### 📄 **PL-2027-A2: Ephemeral State C2**

*   **Abstract:** *This paper details a Command & Control methodology that utilizes public Certificate Transparency Logs and blockchain testnet smart contracts as a globally replicated, immutable, and uncensorable broadcast mechanism. We demonstrate how to pass instructions to a distributed swarm with zero network traffic attributable to the operator.*
*   **Status:** In Peer Review

### 📄 **PL-2027-G5: WebGPU for Parallelized Cryptanalysis**

*   **Abstract:** *An analysis of modern browser WebGPU capabilities for orchestrating massively parallel, client-side cryptanalytic attacks. This paper includes performance benchmarks for brute-forcing various hashing algorithms by transforming a fleet of transient web visitors into a temporary, high-performance GPU cluster.*
*   **Status:** In Progress
